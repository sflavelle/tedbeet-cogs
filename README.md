# tedbeet-cogs
Hello! This is a collection of cogs I've made or modified specifically for the Tedbeet instance of Twentysix's Red bot for Discord. By "modified" this is usually changing who can use commands from different cogs. I will be linking to the different original cogs in this README so you may obtain those versions instead of ours.

However, if you need to obtain one or multiple cogs from this repository, you may do so by invoking the following command to your Red bot:
`[p]cog repo add tedbeet https://github.com/sflavelle/tedbeet-cogs`

# Commands
## trigger
This is modified from Twentysix's own repo: https://github.com/Twentysix26/26-Cogs/blob/master/trigger/

* Adding to, creating, removing from, and setting most options on a trigger is now available to all users.
* *Deleting a trigger can only be done by a server admin, as normal.*
* *Setting a trigger's influence can only be done by the bot owner, as normal.*
